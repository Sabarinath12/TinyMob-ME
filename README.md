TinyMob OS 


This project is a firmware-like operating system in the very early stages of development, built using C and GTK for efficiency. Running on top of the NetBSD kernel, itâ€™s designed for touch based feature phones and low-resource devices. The primary motive of this project is to create a non-distracting, minimalistic OS that helps users stay focused. With a no-bloat philosophy, it only includes essential components to ensure a fast and lightweight experience, providing a clean and straightforward environment for productive use.
