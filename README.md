TinyMob OS 


TinyMob OS is a lightweight mobile environment in its early stages of development, built using C and GTK for maximum efficiency. It runs on top of the Linux/FreeBSD/Netbsd base with X11 as the display server, and is designed specifically for touch-based feature phones and low-resource devices.
The core goal of the project is to create a minimal, distraction-free ui that helps users stay focused. TinyMob-ME includes only essential components to deliver a fast, clean, and straightforward user experience â€” ideal for productivity and simplicity.
